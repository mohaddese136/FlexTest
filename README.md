# Dynamic MetaTrader Backtest System

A web-based interface for automating MetaTrader 5 backtests with dynamic parameter configuration.

## What It Does

This system automatically reads your MQL5 Expert Advisor file and creates a web form for all input parameters. You can then run backtests with different settings and time periods (such as weekly, monthly, overall) without manually editing configuration files, at the end it Shows profit/loss and drawdown for each test period.

## Quick Start

1. Run: `python main.py`
2. Open: `http://localhost:5000`
3. Configure parameters and run backtests
